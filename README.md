# TDDE35-project-14

Ad hoc routing simulator for DSDV, DSR and GPSR in C++.

Simulator Code:
- C++-+
- done at the latest by April 27
- Specify topology in txt file, one line represents an entry where entry values are separated by space
- Super fancy function that loads and creates the topology from a given file ("Wow!")
- Visual representation of the topology (maybe with animations?)
- Links as objects probably => greater control over jitter and links breaking
- Packets as objects, contains (size of) data, type (routing or data transfer), source and destination node
